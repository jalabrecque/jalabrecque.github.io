### About this blog

> "Forgive me my nonsense, as I also forgive the nonsense of those that think they talk sense."
- Robert Frost

I know blogs died like in 2013 or something, but I always have these thoughts when I'm reading things and my first reaction is: don't tell anyone or they'll scoop you. What a bad attitude to have. So, if I ever get around to this, I'm just going to write all my ideas here and hopefully they end up contributing positively or not at all.
