I'm a postdoctoral fellow at Erasmus MC in the Rotterdam, The Netherlands. My interests are wide including causal inference, social epidemiology, genetic epidemiology and instrumental variable analyses.

### More Information

I know blogs died like in 2013 or something, but I always have these thoughts when I'm reading things and my first reaction is: don't tell anyone or they'll scoop you. What a bad attitude to have. So, if I ever get around to this, I'm just going to write all my ideas here and hopefully they end up contributing positively or not at all.
