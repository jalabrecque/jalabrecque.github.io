We worry so much about measurement in epidemiology. (Or at least we should.) We teach about the bias and lack of precision that can occur due to measurement error. We ask participants in our studies to be as accurate as possible when filling out questionnaires to avoid measurement error to the extent possible. So where does this concern about measurement go when it comes to authorship?

Most fields have come up with ways of implicitly communicating to the reader the relative contribution of each author. In epidemiology, my field, the first author is the lead author of the paper, the last author is the senior author (although this can mean different things) and sometimes the second author or second to last author can have some additional prestige (depends on who you talk to). Everyone else is just in the middle.

Why are we hesitant to make clear what each authors' contributions are? There are a whole host of ways you can contribute to a paper. [CRediT (Contributor Roles Taxonomy)](https://www.casrai.org/credit.html) identifies 14 and there are likely many more. There are many roles on that list such as data curation, funding acquisition and reviewing and editing, that, by themselves do not qualify for authorship but are nonetheless important roles. Understandably, we want to compensate people who fulfill these important roles and the only way we have to do so is authorship.

Imagine if, instead, we could directly acknowledge how each author contributed. It would give so much additional information for people who need to evaluate researchers. If someone has a lot of publications because they created a popular dataset (a crucially important part of research) they would be recognized for their extraordinary contribution to data generation rather than just being a middle author. I know people who put so much effort into peer review and get almost no recognition for it. Meanwhile, some publications include authors who gave a cursory look at the manuscript, asked, "have you thought about additional co-authors?" and get a publication's worth of credit.  

Without attributing malice or blame to anyone, the fact that we don't know what a specific author contributed to a paper will benefit some people and will not benefit others. Although it's possible that the net benefit to everyone is zero, more likely there are people who are benfitting more in our current system and others who would benefit more under a more transparent system. 

Sure, it's probably not comfortable to have these conversations with co-authors to make it clear what everyone contributed. But we ask participants in our studies to answer sensitive questions all the time and so I think it's only fair that we be prepared to experiences a little discomfort ourselves if it leads to better science.
